# ServerMessenger
This is a simple TCP server and client connection, and when software on my server has an error, it is redirected to an error file, which this
server program reads, and sends to the client, which prints it to a file on the client machine. Also, when the error is received, a windows 
message is sent to rainmeter, which changes the image in a skin, to alert me that there is an error I haven't seen.
